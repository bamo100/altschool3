        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Prepare the base</u>: Heat vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add diced onions and saut√© until translucent and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Build the flavor</strong>: Add tomato paste to the onions and fry for 2-3 minutes until it darkens slightly. Then add the blended tomatoes and peppers, cooking for 15-20 minutes until the mixture reduces and the raw taste disappears.</li>
            <li>Season the sauce: Add curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, and stock cubes. If using chicken, add it now and cook for 10 minutes until partially cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the rice: Rinse the rice until water runs clear, then add to the pot. Stir gently to coat each grain with the tomato mixture, being careful not to break the rice.</li>
            <li><em>Perfect the cooking</em>: Pour in the stock gradually, add scotch bonnet pepper if desired, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 20-25 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Rest and serve: Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork. Remove bay leaves and serve hot with your favorite sides.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The secret to perfect Jollof rice is achieving the right balance of liquid to rice ratio and allowing the bottom to get slightly crispy for that authentic <mark>"party rice"</mark> flavor that Nigerians love. Don't stir too much during cooking - let the rice do its magic! For extra richness, you can add a tablespoon of butter at the end of cooking.</p>
